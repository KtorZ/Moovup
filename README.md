## What is Moovup?
Moovup is a web-application on which I worked on during more or less eight months. I was
working for the start-up on my free time, in order to help them to technically set-up their project.
Moovup is a platform which aims two kind of targets ; On the one hand, it targets local shopkeepers
who needs to bring customers from their home to inside their shops. It could be restaurants, clothes
stores or even garages as well. On the other hand, it offers to web surfers a tool to see and browse
promotions and offers of local stores around them.


## How it works?
* Moovup aims two type of users : professionals/shopkeepers and customers.
* Shopkeepers could create and manage two kind of entities : shop and offer.
* A shop refers to physical existing store. Moovup automatically builds a presentation page
for each shop in his database which present contact and description information, and also
current active offers.
* An offer refers to a promotion or a good deal that a shop could potentially propose.
* Shopkeepers can publish offers inside some of their shops for a given time.
* Users are free to browse active offers or existing shops.
* All shops and users are geolocalized thus it is possible to propose relevant content to users.
* Offers are ordered by categories and themes and are managed at an administration level.
* Users can like their favorite shops in order to access to their offers and information easily.


## What does it rely on?
* The whole application is built upon the ruby framework Ruby On Rails.
* Modern web technologies are also included such as Jquery, html5, css3 and Bootstrap.
* All files and server are hosted thanks to Heroku, which allows an easy build and deployment
through a git repository.
* Heroku also provides a PostgreSQL database even if SQLite is use locally.
* The whole design is fully responsive and uses Ajax to improve user experience.
* A bunch of Ruby gems and Jquery plugins (Devise, Geocoder, PaperClip, FancyBox and
more ...) are used in order not to reimplement already existing features.


You can access to a demo version directly on the heroku domain by the link below.
